Description: This package queries the SNPs data sets and makes plots of
        genes and SNPs.  This package allows users to access these data
        sets once they have been compiled into one file and indexed
        with Tabix (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tabix.shtml). There
        are functions to retrieve SNPs, subset them for specific
        strains, obtain only SNPs that are polymorphic for a subset of
        strains, plot SNPs and look for certain allele patterns in
        SNPs. We have also added functions to access indels and
        structural variants.
